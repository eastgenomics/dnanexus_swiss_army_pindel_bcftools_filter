# Filter pindel VCF files
# Started: CC10Feb2021

# Description: Filters pindel output vcfs using bcftools (v1.11) within the Swiss Army Knife app (v4.0.1) on DNAnexus
# Inputs: .bed file defining target regions and .vcf file(s) containing variants to filter
# Outputs: filtered .vcf.gz file and associated .tbi file

# Reference(s): 
# https://platform.dnanexus.com/app/swiss-army-knife
